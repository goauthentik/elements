/**
 * @fileoverview This module implements a state machine for tooltip behavior that ensures smooth
 * user interactions by preventing tooltip spam when moving across anchor elements quickly, while
 * allowing seamless transitions between anchor and tooltip elements.
 *
 * The `TooltipEvent` class contains the API needed to support transitions from one state to another
 * inside a `Tooltip`, and the four states inherit from it. It's completely self- contained, there's
 * no "state manager"; a transition results in calls to the Tooltip API to show or hide, but
 * timeouts are dependent on the state being live so they live on the state itself.
 *
 * Getting a better tooltip required meeting the goal that moving across the anchor quickly
 * shouldn't cause the tooltip to show up immediately, as that would spam a display with a lot of
 * tooltips. It also shouldn't fade out when the pointer transitions from the anchor to the tooltip
 * itself.
 *
 * When you hover or focus an anchor element, the tooltip is *scheduled to show*, which can be
 * canceled by leaving the anchor before it becomes visible. Likewise, when the tooltip is visible,
 * the tooltip is *scheduled to hide* when the pointer transitions away, which can be canceled by
 * the pointer returning to hover or focus either element.
 *
 * The state machine handles four distinct states:
 * - **Hidden**: Initial state, tooltip is not visible
 * - **Scheduled to Show**: Tooltip is queued to appear after hover/focus on anchor
 * - **Showing**: Tooltip is currently visible to the user
 * - **Scheduled to Hide**: Tooltip is queued to disappear after pointer leaves elements
 *
 * State transitions:
 * - Hidden → Scheduled to Show (on anchor mouseover/focus)
 * - Scheduled to Show → Hidden (on anchor mouseout before timeout) OR Showing (timeout completes)
 * - Showing → Scheduled to Hide (on pointer leave)
 * - Scheduled to Hide → Showing (on pointer return) OR Hidden (timeout completes)
