The ContentHeader Component is an image component for showing a logo or other product information.

## Analysis

The React implementation is little more than pre-defined a collection of breakpoints for setting the
width and height of the contentheader, and set the width and height of the container. The image itself is
"inline-flex", but nthonig is actually done with that and told to max out its width to fill the
container.
