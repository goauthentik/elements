authentik Elements provides accessible, professional web-components built for the authentik Single
Sign-On Server and associated products. We provide a default theme and light/dark modes for that
theme, but leave the door open to it being fully customizable and configurable.

authentik started as a [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/) 4-based application, and it is our
intent that our default theme should continue to live close to the look and feel of Patternfly 5.
The guidelines and templates provided by Patternfly 5 are excellent, and while at this point we feel
it necessary to forge our own unique identity, our foundational look and feel will be with us for a
long, long time.

authentik Elements is not the end of this story. Learning from the team that brought us Patternfly
5, we should also look to other CSS libraries. IBM's Carbon is illustrative: the core Carbon look
and feel exists in [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon), but IBM's own website
builds on top of that by providing aggregate components for [Carbon For
IBM](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom). Our SSO product will need
something very like a "... for *authentik*" library to describe our unique masthead, sidebar,
dashboards, and displays.
