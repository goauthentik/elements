# authentik elements

[authentik elements]() is a collection of elements maintained by Authentik Security, Inc., to
support the authentik Single Sign-On server and related projects.

Many of the components in this library, most notably those in the "core" folder but also many of the
elements in the "components" folder, were developed by the [Patternfly
Elements](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements) community. As of this writing (March of
2025), the Patternfly Elements community has been more or less stagnant, relying on Patternfly 4,
whereas we have been moving forward with our independently developed elements and have several
Patternfly 5-compatible components in the works.

To the best of our ability, we will honor the open source licenses that Red Hat and authentik have
in common, and give credit where credit is due.

## Where we differ

Unlike the goals of Patternfly Elements, authentik's elements are data-heavy and lit-aware; if we
need to pass in an array of structured data, we will do so.
